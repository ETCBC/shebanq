    "# Verbal valence\n",
    "\n",
    "*Verbal valence* is a kind of signature of a verb, not unlike overloading in programming languages.\n",
    "The meaning of a verb depends on the number and kind of its complements, i.e. the linguistic entities that act as parameters for the semantic function of the verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a set of flowcharts to specify and compute the sense of a verb in specific contexts depending on the verbal valence it has in that context. The flowcharts are by Janet Dyk. Although they are not difficult to understand, it takes a good deal of ingenuity to apply them in all the real world situations that we encounter in our corpus.\n",

    "They can be summarized as a set of flowcharts. Each flowchart describes set of rules how to choose between\n",
    "the senses of a specific verb based on the constituents in each context where it occurs.\n",
    "The role of Dirk is to turn those ideas into a working program base on the ETCBC data.\n",

    "* detect phrases starting with MN (*from*) and offer them as potential direct objects.\n",

    "# Flowchart logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the bare logic of the flow charts for the individual verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``senses`` data structure is a dictionary keyed by verb lexemes. \n",
    "For each verb it is keyed by *sense labels*, which is a code for the number of direct object and the nature of complements that are present in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind each sense label there is information about the meaning of the verb in such a context.\n",
    "The meaning consists of 2 or 3 pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important part is the second one, the *sense template*, which consist of a gloss augmented with placeholders for the direct objecs and complements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **{verb}** the verb occurrence in question\n",
    "* **{pdo}** principal direct object\n",
    "* **{sdos}** secundary direct objects\n",
    "* **{inds}** indirect objects\n",
    "* **{locs}** locatives\n",
    "* **{cpls}** complements, not marked as either indirect object or locative\n",
    "\n",
    "In case there are multiple entities, the algorithm returns them chunked as phrases/clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the template, there is also a *status* and an optional *account*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The status is ``!`` in normal cases, ``?`` in dubious cases, and ``-`` in erroneous cases.\n",
    "In SHEBANQ these statuses are translated into colors of the notes (blue/orange/red).\n",
    "\n",
    "The account contains information about the grounds of which the algorithm has arrived at its conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **{ilc}** the outcome of the heuristic that distinguishes locatives from indirect objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical case is ``NTN[`` sense ``0c``. This verbs prefers indirect objects and not locatives.\n",
    "So when the context has a complement that fails to be classified beforehand as either locative or indirect object, this is the moment that we finally decide it is an indirect object after all.\n",
    "But this is risky, so we give it status ``?`` and we tell the user that we have decided to change ``C`` into ``I`` for this complement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, sense ``0l`` is not expected to occur. When we encounter it, we conclude that our heuristic for choosing between ``L`` and ``I`` has failed here, and we overrule that decision and change ``L`` to ``I``.\n",
    "We tell the user that here we have encountered an error."

    "\n",
    "Clauses that function as direct object are never the principal direct object. So we restrict to direct objects at the phrase level, either being complete phrases, or pronominal suffixes within phrases. The following rules express a preference for the principal direct object. In a given context, we select the direct object that is preferred by applying those rules as the principal direct object. We only apply these rules if there are at least two objects.\n",

    "An object phrase is *marked* if and only if it contains, somewhere, the object marker ``>T``.\n",
    "If there are marked object phrases, we pick the one that is textually first (by rule 3 below) and stop applying rules.\n",
    "Otherwise we proceed with the next rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 2: determined phrases > undetermined phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "We only arrive here if there are multiple ``Objc`` phrases, neither of which is marked.\n",
    "In this case, we take the textually first one (by rule 3) which has the value ``det`` for its feature ``det``, if there is one, and stop applying rules.\n",
    "Otherwise we proceed with the next rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 3: earlier phrases > later phrases (by textual order)\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is implicitly applied if one of the rules before yielded more than one candidate for the principal object. Furthermore, we arrive here if the previous rules have not selected any principal direct object, while we do have more than one ``Objc`` phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we pick the textually first ``Objc`` phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NB: Implied object\n",
