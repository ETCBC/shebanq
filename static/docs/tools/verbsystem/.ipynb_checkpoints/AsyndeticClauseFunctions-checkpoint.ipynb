      "This program serves two major functions. First of all, it has provided its developer with some initial experience in the use of the [LAF Fabric Workbench](http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), which was and is still being developed by Dirk Roorda and is expected to play a significant role in future research conducted by the <em>Eep Talstra Center for Bible and Computing</em>, of which the program's developer is a member.\n",
      "Second, the specific queries conducted in the program provide us with new insights into the object of the developer's PhD research, i.e.: <strong>the functions of the verbal forms in Biblical Hebrew poetry</strong>.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main assumption in this research project is that the meaning of the Biblical Hebrew verbal forms is mainly determined by the clause patterns in which they occur. Thus, verbal forms in a daughter clause may adopt volitive and non-volitive aspects of meaning from verbal forms in their mother clauses. Furthermore, the verbal forms essentially fulfill a function at the discourse level, at which they denote shifts in type (narrative vs. discursive) and level (mainline vs. background) of communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current program investigates the differences between the Biblical Hebrew genres (prose, poetry and prophecy) in their use of these clause patterns. Since the number of different types of clause patterns is quite high, we decided to focus on the patterns that involve an asyndetic relation between two clauses.\n",
      "In our database, the type of clause pattern is annotated by a three-digit label, which is attached to both the mother clause and the daughter clause. The asyndetic clause connections are assigned labels from 100 up to 168. The first digit in the offset from 100 is the tense of the verbal predicate of the daughter clause atom, the second that of the mother clause atom. The digit-representations of the Hebrew tenses are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "0 None<br>\n",
      "1 Imperfect --> yiqtol<br>\n",
      "2 Perfect --> qatal<br>\n",
      "3 Imperative<br>\n",
      "4 Infinitive Construct<br>\n",
      "5 Infinitive Absolute<br>\n",
      "6 Participle<br>\n",
      "7 Imperfect Consecutive --> wayyiqtol<br>\n",
      "8 Imperfect Copulative --> weyiqtol<br>\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the final two tenses (7 and 8) cannot be used in asyndetic clause connections - the waw being the Hebrew copulative - the first digit in the offset from 100 will never be higher than 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program calculates for each of the possible patterns in the range 100-168 the number of occurrences in the books and chapters that are included in the three categories of prosaic, poetic and prophetic texts. Since the total numbers of patterns are very different for each of the genres - thus, a large part of the Hebrew poetry (e.g. the Psalms) had not yet been analyzed in the data set that is currently used by the <strong>'LAF Fabric Workbench'</strong> - the program also calculates for each of the clause patterns its relative value, i.e.: which portion of the total number of clause patterns in a given genre is represented by that specific clause pattern.

      "From the table above some interesting insights can be deduced. Thus, we find several patterns that are more strongly attested in one genre than in another. In poetry, for instance, a sequence of two perfects (21: qatal > qatal) is the second most occurring asyndetic clause pattern, while in prose other combinations of mother and daughter clause are more prominent, especially those containing a imperfect consecutive (wayyiqtol) mother clause.<br>\n",
      "On the other hand, the differences in numbers of occurrences are not extreme, which appears to support our research hypothesis that prose and poetry make use of one single verbal system. They clearly show some mutual differences in their preferences for specific patterns within this system, but the table seems to suggest indeed that this does not entail that the two genres make use of wholly different linguistic systems (or - as many Hebraists assume implicitly - that poetry's of verbal forms isn't bound to any grammatical rules at all).
